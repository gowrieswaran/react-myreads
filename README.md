# My Reads

- My Reads is a book tracking App that allow users to categorize books into one of the three shelves like Currently reading, To be read and Read. One can Add/Search books to/from any of the category shelves. 

- None allows you remove the book from every shelves.

- The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

- The project focuses on state management, routing.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the starter repository

2. Install all project dependencies with npm install

3. Start the development server with npm start

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file BooksAPI.js contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

1. getAll
2. update
3. search

# Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md. That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

### Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. You can find more information on how to perform common tasks here.
